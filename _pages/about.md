**I am an incoming Assistant Professor at Rutgers University Computer Science, starting in Fall 2024.** 

I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of California Santa Barbara, where I worked with Professor William Wang. My research focuses on natural language processing, with an emphasis on Responsible AI. I work on problems relating to fairness, trustworthiness, and safety. I have spent summers as a research intern at AWS AI, Meta, and Pinterest. I am a 2022 EECS Rising Star, a recipient of the Amazon Alexa AI Fellowship for Responsible AI, and have previously received the Regents and Holbrook Fellowships at my university.
