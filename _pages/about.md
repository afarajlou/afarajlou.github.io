**A recent graduate with a master's degree in Computer Architecture from Amirkabir University of Technology (Hardware engineer)** 

I am a recent graduate with a master's degree in Computer Architecture from Amirkabir University of Technology.
During my studies, I gained valuable experience in designing and implementing parallel algorithms on FPGA platforms using tools like Xilinx Vivado, HLS, and PYNQ. I have a particular interest in the design of FPGA accelerators for AI applications.
I am eager to contribute my insights and skills to the advancement of hardware solutions for accelerating AI algorithms.
